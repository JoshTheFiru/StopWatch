# Vanilla JS StopWatch
This project is a simple Vanilla JS StopWatch made for practice. 
It takes three main different parts: 
 - Header
 - Digits that will be measuring time (2 for seconds and 2 for decimals)
 - Buttons that will make function the app. (Start, Stop, Reset)
 
 The idea has been taken from https://mikkegoes.com/javascript-projects-for-beginners/ where you can find an awesome list of begginer and intermediate projects
 for JS practicing.
